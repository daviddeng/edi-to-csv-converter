Replace icon.jpg with any 110px by 110px jpg image or remove it.

upc_check_digit.py is by corpit. Source is at https://gist.github.com/corpit/8204593. Thank him for that one.

This program currently only works properly on Windows. This will be fixed.

Future plans:

2. Clean up backend into something reusable.
3. Full cross platform support.
